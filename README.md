iOS-SOAP-Example
================

A sample iOS App project to demonstrate how you can interact with a SOAP based Web Services Implementation. The project uses client-side code generated from the SOAP Web Services Definition File (WSDL) file using a free utility called "wsdl2objc". Details of how to use the tool and specifics of the app are described in this blog post http://www.priyaontech.com/2012/10/soap-based-webservices-integration-in-an-ios-app/.
